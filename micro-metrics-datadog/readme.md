# Datadog metrics plugin for Microserver

[micro-metrics-datadog example apps](https://github.com/aol/micro-server/tree/master/micro-metrics-datadog/src/test/java/app/datadog/metrics)

This adds support for sending the metrics to Datadog if an api key is provided in the application.properties file. For more detailed info see [metrics-datadog](https://github.com/coursera/metrics-datadog/)

This plugin in combination with the micro-event-metrics plugin will send some metrics to datadog by default. Refer here (https://github.com/aol/micro-server/blob/master/micro-event-metrics/src/main/java/com/aol/micro/server/event/metrics/MetricsCatcher.java)

 # Configuring datadog metrics Reporters
 
 By default we report to the datadog every second. with the tag stage:dev. To modify these settings, change the values in the application.properties file.
 For example:
 The application.peroperties file can be modifed as follows,
 datadog.apikey = <your api key goes here>
 datadog.tags = "stage:dev", "owner:abc"
 datadog.report.period = 10
 datadog.report.timeunit = SECONDS
 This will report the metrics to datadog with tags as "stage:dev" and "owner:abc" and for every 10 seconds
